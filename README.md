# Salaries-of-a-company

Implement a program where I can store a list of at least 100 workers.

For each worker, we must store, his name, his base salary (number), and his complement (also a number).

We must be able to calculate the global total salary for the workers, i.e. the sum of base salary and its complement.

Your program should list all the workers and print their names, base salaries, complements, and total salaries.

Additional questions:

Is your design ready to easily accept changes in how to calculate the total salary? for example for calculating the total salary taking into account taxes.
How to implement the case where I don't use all of the 100 "spaces" for workers? I.e my company only have 20.
You should implement your solution in Java with IntelliJ and create a Github repository for it.
